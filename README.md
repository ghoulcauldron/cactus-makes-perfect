<file name=0 path=/Users/gilcalderon/cactus-makes-perfect/README.md># Cactus Makes Perfect üåµ‚ú®  
Santa Fe 20th Anniversary Guest Portal

This repo contains a monorepo with:

- **Frontend:** React + Vite + Tailwind + TypeScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express + Supabase  
- **Infra:** Railway deployment configs, Dockerfiles  

## Quickstart (local)

### Frontend
```bash
cd apps/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend
```bash
cd apps/backend
npm install
node server.js
```

## Deployment (Railway)

- Recommended single-service deploy: the backend service builds the frontend and serves it from the `/public` directory.
- An alternative two-service deployment (separate nginx frontend + API backend) is possible but not required.
- When attaching a custom domain, map `www.cactusmakesperfect.org` to the backend service.
- Basic Auth protects all routes during private testing to restrict access.
- Minimal required environment variables checklist:
  - `SUPABASE_URL`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
  - `JWT_SECRET`
  - `EMAIL_PROVIDER`
  - `FROM_EMAIL`
  - `BASIC_AUTH_USER`
  - `BASIC_AUTH_PASS`

## Environment & Config

## API Reference (current)

### POST /api/v1/invites/send
**Payload:** `{ "email": "<guest_email>" }`  
**Response:** `200 { "ok": true }`  
**Side effects:** Inserts a row into `invite_tokens` with `provider`, sets `delivery_status` from `pending` to `sent`, logs `user_activity` event `invite_sent`.

### POST /api/v1/invites/resend
**Payload:** `{ "email": "<guest_email>" }`  
**Response:** `200 { "ok": true }` regardless of guest existence (Option B).  
Logs either `invite_resent` or `invite_resend_failed` in `user_activity`.

### POST /api/v1/auth/verify
**Payload:** `{ "token": "<token>", "code": "<code>" }`  
**Response:** `200 { "token": "<jwt>", "guest_id": "<guest_id>" }` on success.  
Side effects: sets `invite_tokens.used_at` timestamp and updates `delivery_status` to `responded`.

### POST /api/v1/rsvps/me
**Payload:** `{ "guest_id": "<guest_id>", "status": "<rsvp_status>" }`  
**Response:** `200 { "ok": true }` on success.  
Logs `rsvp_submitted` event in `user_activity`.

### GET /health
Returns health status of the backend service. Can be public if desired.

## Data Model Notes

Key database tables and notable columns:

- **guests**  
  - `email` (unique)  
  - `first_name`, `last_name`  
  - `invited_at`, `responded_at`

- **invite_tokens**  
  - `guest_id` (foreign key)  
  - `token` (unique string)  
  - `code` (numeric or alphanumeric code)  
  - `expires_at` (typically 30 days after creation)  
  - `provider` (e.g., mailtrap, sendgrid)  
  - `delivery_status` (pending, sent, responded)  
  - `used_at` (timestamp when token was used)  
  - `created_at`

- **user_activity**  
  - `guest_id`  
  - `kind` (event type, e.g., invite_sent, rsvp_submitted)  
  - `meta` (jsonb with event details)  
  - `created_at`

Example query to audit latest invites joined to guests:

```sql
SELECT g.email, g.first_name, g.last_name, i.token, i.code, i.delivery_status, i.used_at, i.created_at
FROM invite_tokens i
JOIN guests g ON i.guest_id = g.id
ORDER BY i.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## Frontend Behavior

- Routes:
  - `/` ‚Äî Landing page or redirect.
  - `/invite?token=...` ‚Äî Invite landing page with token parameter.
  - `/guest/login` ‚Äî CalculatorAuth screen for code entry.
  - `/guest/welcome` ‚Äî Welcome page after successful auth.
  - `/guest/rsvp` ‚Äî RSVP form for guests.

- Production guard: If no `token` is provided in the URL and `VITE_DEBUG` is `false`, the CalculatorAuth screen shows a message: ‚ÄúPlease use your invite link‚Äù.

- After successful `/auth/verify`, the app stores `auth_token` (JWT) and `guest_user_id` in `localStorage`.

- `ProtectedRoute` components require a valid `auth_token` in localStorage to grant access.

- RSVP submissions post `guest_id` retrieved from localStorage.

## Project Roadmap

### Completed Phases

- Phase 1‚Äì4:
  - Invite issuing system with tokenized URLs.
  - CalculatorAuth verification with JWT issuance and localStorage persistence.
  - RSVP POST endpoint and activity logging.
  - Mailtrap integration via API for invite delivery.
  - Tracking of provider, delivery_status, and used_at timestamps for invites.

#### Phase 4 ‚Äì Success Criteria Achieved
- Full invite and verification flow functioning end-to-end (Mailtrap sandbox).
- Tokenized URLs verified to land on CalculatorAuth correctly.
- Correct code entry issues JWT and persists guest_id to localStorage.
- RSVP form submits successfully and logs user_activity.
- Basic Auth and ‚Äúuse invite link‚Äù guard functioning as intended.

#### Phase 7 ‚Äì QA Matrix Success Criteria Achieved
- Successful QA testing with Mailtrap sandbox environment completed.
- Email invites render correctly with unique tokenized URLs and codes.
- Authentication flow accepts valid token and code, issues JWT, and redirects appropriately.
- RSVP submissions record guest responses and log user_activity events accurately.
- UI guards display ‚ÄúPlease use your invite link‚Äù message when appropriate.
- Basic Auth protection verified to restrict access during private testing.
- All critical user flows validated end-to-end ensuring stable release readiness.

### Upcoming Phases

- Phase 5: (Deferred) Two-way communications and SMS notifications pending Admin Dashboard development.

- Phase 6: Domains & Identity  
  Custom email identity setup including SendGrid integration, SPF/DKIM/DMARC configuration, and optional inbound parse.  
  Transition note: Mailtrap (dev/testing) ‚Üí SendGrid (production) once domains/DNS are ready.

- Phase 7: QA Matrix  
  - Dev environment: Invite 10‚Äì20 mock users; verify email rendering and links.  
  - Auth calculator: Accepts correct {token + code}, rejects wrong code and expired tokens.  
  - RSVP: Writes guest responses and activity logs.  
  - Staging environment: Verify Gmail, Outlook, iCloud inbox reception with no broken images or links.  
  - Spam checks: Adjust content, DKIM, SPF as needed.  
  - Error handling: Friendly UI for 401 errors (calculator modal on invalid).  
  - Token reuse: Reusing token is allowed until expiry (by design).

- Phase 8: RSVP modal + Event Details modal + FAQs modal (renaming planned).

## QA Checklist
### Dev (Mailtrap)
- [ ] Invite 10‚Äì20 mock users; verify email renders & links  
- [ ] Calculator auth accepts correct {token + code}, rejects wrong code, expired token  
- [ ] RSVP writes row + activity log  

### Staging (real inboxes)
- [ ] Gmail, Outlook, iCloud accounts receive mail, no broken images/links  
- [ ] Check spam placement; adjust content/DKIM/SPF if needed  

### Error handling
- [ ] 401 cases produce friendly UI (calculator modal on invalid)  
- [ ] Server logs user_activity for failures (optional)  

**Note:** The ‚ÄúPlease use your invite link‚Äù message is visible only when `VITE_DEBUG=false`.

## Mailtrap QA Test Plan

### Mailtrap QA Test Plan

#### Purpose
To verify the full end-to-end invite and verification system works using Mailtrap‚Äôs sandbox environment before switching to SendGrid in production.

#### Steps
1. **Seed test users**
   - Insert 10‚Äì20 mock guests into Supabase (e.g. Ava, Beau, Cam, etc.).
   - Confirm each has a unique email address in `guests`.

2. **Send invites**
   - For each test guest, POST to `/api/v1/invites/send` with `{ "email": "<guest_email>" }`.
   - Verify `invite_tokens` and `user_activity` tables receive corresponding rows.

3. **Check Mailtrap inbox**
   - Ensure each email arrives with correct subject, HTML + text versions.
   - Confirm tokenized invite link resolves to `/invite?token=...` on the site.
   - Validate unique codes are shown in each email and expire as expected.

4. **Verify login**
   - Paste invite link into browser ‚Üí ensure CalculatorAuth screen loads.
   - Enter code ‚Üí expect successful JWT issuance and redirect to `/guest/welcome`.

5. **Edge case testing**
   - Enter wrong or expired code ‚Üí confirm ‚ÄúNOPE‚Äù modal.
   - Reusing token is allowed until expiry (by design).
   - Missing token or malformed link ‚Üí show ‚ÄúPlease use your invite link‚Äù message (visible only if `VITE_DEBUG=false`).

6. **Log validation**
   - In backend logs, confirm:
     - ‚ÄúFound guest‚Äù + ‚ÄúInserted invite token‚Äù + ‚ÄúEmail sent‚Äù messages.
     - Each successful invite and verify action logs `user_activity` events.

7. **Email deliverability simulation**
   - Review spam score and rendering in Mailtrap‚Äôs preview.
   - Confirm SPF/DKIM placeholders are acceptable for dev.

#### Success Criteria
- All test invites send without errors.
- Tokenized URLs open CalculatorAuth correctly.
- Correct codes authenticate; incorrect codes reject gracefully.
- Activity logs are complete for every test user.
- Emails render and link correctly in Mailtrap.

## Future Improvements

Add a UI flow for guests to request a resend of their invite link by entering their email. This UI would call the existing `/api/v1/invites/resend` endpoint, which currently logs invalid attempts but does not have a user interface yet.

Invite email design

- request invite token email resend (self or admin)
- create guest relationships/households to bundle responses
- flow to change/edit RSVP response.

## Phase 6: Domains & Identity Rollout Plan

This rollout plan outlines the detailed steps to configure custom domains, set up SendGrid for email delivery, and validate the setup before transitioning to production.

### DNS Setup

- [ ] Identify the custom domain(s) to be used for the guest portal and email sending.
- [ ] Access the DNS provider‚Äôs management console for the domain(s).
- [ ] Add or update the following DNS records:
  - [ ] **SPF Record:** Add a TXT record authorizing SendGrid IPs to send emails on behalf of the domain.
  - [ ] **DKIM Records:** Add the CNAME records provided by SendGrid for domain authentication.
  - [ ] **DMARC Record (optional but recommended):** Add a TXT record to specify the DMARC policy.
- [ ] Verify that all DNS records have propagated correctly using tools like `dig`, `nslookup`, or online DNS checkers.
- [ ] Document the DNS changes and expected propagation times.

### SendGrid Configuration

- [ ] Log into the SendGrid dashboard.
- [ ] Navigate to the Sender Authentication section.
- [ ] Complete domain authentication by linking the custom domain.
- [ ] Verify that SendGrid confirms successful domain authentication.
- [ ] Create or update API keys with appropriate permissions for sending emails.
- [ ] Configure the sending domain and email addresses in SendGrid.
- [ ] Set up any necessary suppression lists, templates, or tracking settings.

### Testing & Validation

- [ ] Send test emails from the development environment using the new SendGrid configuration.
- [ ] Verify email deliverability in major email clients (Gmail, Outlook, iCloud).
- [ ] Check for correct SPF, DKIM, and DMARC alignment in email headers.
- [ ] Confirm that emails do not land in spam or junk folders.
- [ ] Test unsubscribe and bounce handling as configured.
- [ ] Validate that email templates render correctly across devices.
- [ ] Monitor SendGrid dashboard for any sending errors or warnings.

### Transition to Production

- [ ] Update environment variables in production to switch from Mailtrap to SendGrid.
- [ ] Deploy updated backend services with SendGrid integration enabled.
- [ ] Perform a limited production rollout to a small group of real users.
- [ ] Monitor email delivery metrics and user feedback closely.
- [ ] Gradually increase the volume of emails sent via SendGrid in production.
- [ ] Document the transition process and any issues encountered for future reference.

## Troubleshooting

- **401 on RSVP** ‚Üí Likely missing `guest_user_id` in localStorage; ensure `/auth/verify` returns `guest_id` and the client saves it.
- **400 on RSVP** ‚Üí API expects `{ guest_id, status }` (not `user_id`).
- **Email hangs** ‚Üí Set `DEV_SKIP_EMAIL=true` to isolate; verify Mailtrap API token and inbox ID; check logs for `[Email] send start`.
- **Basic Auth not prompting** ‚Üí Ensure middleware is registered before routes in backend.
- **Blank page on invite link** ‚Üí Ensure `/invite` route exists in the frontend router and `index.html` uses the correct base URL.
