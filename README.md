  - Integration with third-party identity providers
  - Transition: Mailtrap (dev/testing) â†’ SendGrid (production) once domains/DNS are ready.

- **Phase 7: QA Matrix**
  - Dev environment: Invite 10â€“20 mock users; verify email rendering and links
  - Auth calculator: Accepts correct {token + code}, rejects wrong code and expired tokens
  - RSVP: Writes guest responses and activity logs
  - Staging environment: Verify Gmail, Outlook, iCloud inbox reception with no broken images or links
  - Spam checks: Adjust content, DKIM, SPF as needed
  - Error handling: Friendly UI for 401 errors (calculator modal on invalid), server logs user activity for failures

- **Phase 8: RSVP & Event UI**
  - RSVP modal with improved UX
  - Event Details modal with schedules and info
  - FAQs modal for guest questions

## QA Checklist
### Dev (Mailtrap)
- [ ] Invite 10â€“20 mock users; verify email renders & links  
- [ ] Calculator auth accepts correct {token + code}, rejects wrong code, expired token  
- [ ] RSVP writes row + activity log  

### Staging (real inboxes)
- [ ] Gmail, Outlook, iCloud accounts receive mail, no broken images/links  
- [ ] Check spam placement; adjust content/DKIM/SPF if needed  

### Error handling
- [ ] 401 cases produce friendly UI (calculator modal on invalid)  
- [ ] Server logs user_activity for failures (optional)  

## Future Improvements

Add a UI flow for guests to request a resend of their invite link by entering their email. This UI would call the existing `/api/v1/invites/resend` endpoint, which currently logs invalid attempts but does not have a user interface yet.
